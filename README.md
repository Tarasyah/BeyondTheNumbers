## About This Project
"Beyond the Numbers: The Palestine Data & Memorial Project" was created to provide a clear, focused, and data-driven hub to document and memorialize the human cost of the ongoing crisis in Palestine.

## Inspiration & Data
This project is deeply inspired by the crucial work of platforms like Genocide Monitor.

The statistical backbone of this dashboard is provided by the Palestine Datasets initiative from Tech For Palestine. Their tireless, open-source effort to compile and verify information from sources like the Gaza Ministry of Health, the Gaza Government Media Office, and UN OCHA is what makes the data visualizations on this site possible.
